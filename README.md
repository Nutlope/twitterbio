This project generates Twitter (X) bios for you using AI.

## How it works

This project uses the [ChatGPT API](https://openai.com/api/) and the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) with streaming. It constructs a prompt based on the form and user input, sends it to the ChatGPT API with a Vercel Edge Function, then streams the response back to the application UI.

> This template has recently been updated for the AI SDK, simplifying the amount of code needed. I previously published a [video](https://youtu.be/JcE-1xzQTE0) and [blog post](https://vercel.com/blog/gpt-3-app-next-js-vercel-edge-functions) showing the older approach.

## Running Locally

After cloning the repo, go to [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to make an account and put your API key in a file called `.env`.

Then, run the application in the command line and it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
